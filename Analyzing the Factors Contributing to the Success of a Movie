# Factors Contributing to the Success of a Movie Analysis
Is the movie industry dying? What determines the success of a movie?

## Goal
The goal of this project is to identify the factors that contribute to the success of a movie, specifically whether the production company, the movie's budget, or other variables play a significant role in determining a movie's success. By performing a data analysis using Python, this project aims to provide valuable insights that can help movie production companies make more informed decisions about which movies to produce, which companies to partner with, and how to allocate resources to maximize the chances of success.
